Newest first. One short entry per session.

## 2026-10-17: read through REA

- The owner asked for a quick study of [REA](https://github.com/morluto/rea), a
  reverse-engineering toolkit for AI agents (MIT). Notes are in
  `experiments/2026-10-17-rea-reverse-engineering-tool/`.
- Cloning a public repo for reading still works with no setup.
- The session's safety check blocked running it with `npx` (code downloaded
  from the internet). Reading was fine. To try it, get the owner's go-ahead
  first; the JavaScript analyzer is the easy test since it needs no decompiler.

## 2026-10-17: BIOS update, CPU fan error

- The owner updated their PC's BIOS and got "CPU Fan Error" at startup. Walked
  them through the fix using photos of the screen. Notes on the PC and the fix
  are in `experiments/2026-10-17-bios-cpu-fan-error/`.
- Cause: the cooler is on the AIO_PUMP header and CPU_FAN is empty, and the
  update reset the setting that had been hiding the warning. The fix was to set
  Q-Fan Control to Auto, then the CPU fan low limit to Ignore.
- Sending photos of the screen worked well. The owner followed the BIOS steps
  without trouble once each one named the exact on-screen label.
- A research workflow pulled ASUS's own manuals as PDFs with curl. ASUS's site
  works; the ROG forum, Corsair, and Reddit block automated reads.

## 2026-10-17: Ace Combat 7 co-op research

- The owner found [Co-op Anything](https://github.com/cranebeaker/coop-anything), a
  playbook for adding co-op to single-player games (MIT license). Public repos
  clone fine for reading with no setup.
- Researched Ace Combat 7 co-op: nobody has done it. Notes and sources are in
  `experiments/2026-10-17-ace-combat-7-coop/`. Nexus Mods blocks automated page
  reads, so mod details there came from search snippets only.
- Hands-on game modding can't happen in the cloud workspace (no games, no
  Windows). It would need Claude Code on the owner's PC.
- Tidied `CLAUDE.md`: moved a stray line and added rules for borrowing from
  other projects.

## 2026-10-16: repo setup

- Connected GitHub. Reads worked at first, but pushes and issue creation got 403s
  until the Claude GitHub App was installed on the repo. Both work now.
- Tested an issue end to end (#1: create, comment, close).
- Added the layout, `CLAUDE.md`, this log, and a CI workflow that runs each
  experiment's `check.sh`. `experiments/_template/` doubles as the CI smoke test.
- Created `main`. The owner gave standing permission to merge freely (recorded in
  `CLAUDE.md`). If `main` isn't the default branch yet, the owner has to switch it
  under Settings → General → Default branch; the tools here can't do that.
- First CI run passed.
- The owner asked for plain-language explanations; they're new to programming
  and IT. Added a "Talking to the owner" section to `CLAUDE.md`.

# Workbench (step 0): what was set up and what the tests showed

Done 17 Oct 2026, 20:50 to 22:15, with you watching the game windows. Updated the same
evening, 22:20 to 22:50: the copy now has **its own save folder** (section 4 below).

## Short version

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| Copy of the game made and checked | **Yes.** `C:\AC7-Coop-Game`, 133 files, 65.7 GB. `Ace7Game.exe`'s SHA-256 matches [identity.md](identity.md) exactly. |
| 1. Does the copy start from its own folder? | **Yes, but only when started the way Steam starts games.** Started plainly, it hands itself to Steam and Steam starts your *real* install. With Steam's app label set for that one launch, the copy itself runs and reaches the main menu. |
| 2. Can two copies run at once? | **Not yet.** Both start and reach the title screen, but the second one crashed when it tried to create save data. To be retried now that each copy has its own save folder. |
| 3. Does UE4SS load, open its console and write the object dump? | **Yes, all three.** It found Unreal Engine 4.18 within a second; the console opened; the dump (the game's catalogue of classes and functions) is 30.9 MB. |
| 4. Can the copy keep its saves and settings away from your real ones? | **Yes.** Started with `tools\start-copy.ps1`, the copy now reads and writes `C:\AC7-Coop-Game\UserProfile\...` only. Two title-screen runs wrote 10 settings files there and nothing in your real folder (checked by checksums). The final proof, a run into a mission that quits through the menu, still needs you at the keyboard. |

## What's where

| Thing | Where |
|---|---|
| The plain game copy (no mods, no Mod Loader) | `C:\AC7-Coop-Game` |
| **The copy's own saves and settings** | `C:\AC7-Coop-Game\UserProfile\AppData\Local\BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment\ACE COMBAT 7\` (a second copy uses `UserProfile2`) |
| UE4SS (PM-UE4SS-ZR1903), in the copy only | `C:\AC7-Coop-Game\dwmapi.dll` and `C:\AC7-Coop-Game\ue4ss\` |
| The download, kept as it came | `downloads\PM-UE4SS-ZR1903\` (zip, SHA-256 `8a9574f8c0ddd79b709213547f4ac4d927c14cf0d02be2c503ac9885aa096f13`, same as GitHub shows) |
| Save backups, one per test run | `backups\<date_time>\` |
| The earlier Mod Loader and mission-script tools | `inherited\` (see [inherited/LEFT-OUT.md](inherited/LEFT-OUT.md)) |
| Object dump and UE4SS log from the test | `dumps\2026-10-17_ue4ss-title-screen\` |
| The second copy's crash dump | `dumps\2026-10-17_second-copy-crash\` |
| Back up saves | `tools\backup-saves.ps1` |
| Start the copy (backs up saves first, gives the copy its own save folder) | `tools\start-copy.ps1` |
| Check your real save folder against the latest backup | `tools\compare-saves.ps1` |

To start the copy yourself: open Steam, then in PowerShell run

```
powershell -NoProfile -File "C:\Users\Matth\Claude Apps\AC7-Coop\tools\start-copy.ps1"
```

After a run, to make sure your real saves are untouched:

```
powershell -NoProfile -File "C:\Users\Matth\Claude Apps\AC7-Coop\tools\compare-saves.ps1"
```

## The copy

- Copied with `~mods` and `ModLoader` left out. Your real install wasn't changed.
- All 133 files arrived with the right names and sizes, and `Ace7Game.exe` matches the
  recorded checksum. (I checksummed the exe only, not all 65 GB; the copy tool reported
  no errors.)
- Drive C: went from 316.6 GB to 255.4 GB free.

## Test 1: does the copy start from its own folder?

- **Started plainly** (like double-clicking `Ace7Game.exe`), the copy doesn't run. It asks
  Steam to "run game 502500", and Steam then starts the game from your real install. Steam
  showed a box asking to allow the launch options; it was allowed, so your real game (with
  your mods) ran for 33 seconds at 21:37. Nothing in your save or settings folder changed
  that time.
- **Started with Steam's label.** When Steam starts a game it tells it "you are app 502500".
  Giving the copy that same label for one launch (`SteamAppId=502500`, no file written)
  made the copy run from `C:\AC7-Coop-Game` itself. Steam listed it as Ace Combat 7, its
  overlay attached, and it reached the main menu. Steam still has to be running and still
  checks you own the game; the copy protection runs as normal. `tools\start-copy.ps1`
  does this.
- The game ignores the usual "start in a window" options. Windowed mode had to be set in
  the game's Options, and that setting is shared with your real game (see "Left as you
  chose" below). The copy now has its own copy of that setting (section 4).

## Test 2: can two copies run at once?

- The second copy started fine while the first sat at the main menu. Both used about 1 GB
  of memory and Steam accepted both (Steam's own log shows it tracking both processes
  under the game's app number).
- When you pressed Enter on the second one's title screen, it said it was creating save
  data, wrote a **new** save file in the wrong place (`SaveGames\ACE7Save.sav`, outside
  your Steam-ID folder), and two seconds later crashed (a memory error inside the game,
  22:02:23). Steam's overlay also kept restarting for it.
- Likely reason: Steam gives your account to the first copy only, so the second one
  doesn't know who you are and thinks it has no save. Both copies also shared one save
  folder.
- **What it means:** two copies on this PC aren't usable yet. Now that each copy gets its
  own save folder (section 4; the second copy also gets a copy of your save in the place
  where it looked), the test is ready to be retried. If it still crashes, the cause is the
  missing Steam identity, not the shared folder, and the next idea is to stop the second
  copy from loading a save at all.

## Test 3: UE4SS

- Loaded on every start: UE4SS 3.0.1 beta, the build made for older Unreal versions.
  Steam's wrapper keeps the game's code scrambled for the first second; UE4SS kept looking
  (13 tries) until it was unscrambled by Steam, then found everything it needs, including
  Unreal Engine 4.18.
- Its console window opened on top of the game. (I changed one setting in the copy's
  `ue4ss\UE4SS-settings.ini`, `GuiConsoleVisible = 1`, so it shows on start.)
- Pressing "Dump Objects & Properties" wrote `ue4ss\UE4SS_ObjectDump.txt` in about a
  second: 159,661 lines, 2,377 built-in classes and 6,033 functions. The game's own code
  is listed under the name **Nimbus**. Things we'll need later are in there:
  - the plane classes `PlayerPlane` and `AIPlane`,
  - the mission functions the earlier tools decoded (`StartMissionPhase`, `ActivateUnit`,
    `RestoreUnit`, `GetPlayerPlane`),
  - the leftover developer commands for the online layer as callable functions, for
    example `SNL_ArrangeWindows`, `SNL_EnablePlaneSync`, `SNL_EnableDebugFakeSession`,
    `SNL_ForceCompleteMission`, `SNL_InitializeNetworkEmulator`.
- Small things: four of UE4SS's hooks report "failed". They're the two the settings file
  switches off (`HookInitGameState = 0`, `HookEndPlay = 0`), so that's expected. UE4SS also
  made two empty folders in the copy (`Game\Content\Paks\LogicMods` and `~LogicMods`).
- The dump was taken at the title screen. A dump inside a mission will list more (mission
  scripts load with the mission).

## 4. The copy's own save folder (22:20 to 22:50)

**The problem.** The game asks Windows "where is this user's Local AppData folder?" and
keeps its saves and settings there, in `BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment\ACE COMBAT 7`. The copy
asked the same question and got the same answer as your real game, so both used one folder.

**What I looked at first.** The game's program still contains Unreal Engine's own
switches for moving that folder (`-UserDir=`, `-saveddirsuffix=`, `SaveToUserDir`), right
next to the game's own folder name. So the cheapest idea, a command-line switch, looked
possible. The game's catalogue (the UE4SS dump) also lists its save classes
(`NimbusSaveGame`, `SigmaSaveGame`, `MissionSaveGame`) and the Unreal save functions
(`SaveGameToSlot` and friends), so a UE4SS script could in principle have changed the
save's name on its way to disk. That would have been fiddly and would only have covered
saves, not settings.

**What works.** Windows lets each program be told separately where its user folders are:
a program started with a different "user profile" setting in its environment gets
different answers, and nothing else on the PC is affected. I checked this on your PC with
a small PowerShell test first (the answer followed the setting). `tools\start-copy.ps1`
now does exactly that for the game process it starts, pointing it at
`C:\AC7-Coop-Game\UserProfile`. The game then uses

```
C:\AC7-Coop-Game\UserProfile\AppData\Local\BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment\ACE COMBAT 7\
```

for everything: settings (`Config`), saves (`SaveGames\<your Steam ID>`), and even
Unreal's small `UnrealEngine\4.18` bookkeeping folder landed next to it. No Windows
setting, Steam setting, registry entry or file outside `C:\AC7-Coop-Game` was changed.
The setting is only given to that one game process, and the script puts the PowerShell
window's own settings back right after starting the game.

**First launch copies your settings and save in.** The first time, the script made the
folder and copied your current settings files and your save file (the 10 October save,
696,701 bytes) into it, reading your real files only. So the copy starts in windowed
mode like your real game and has your campaign progress. From then on the two sets of
files live separate lives: nothing the copy does can reach your real save, and your real
game never sees the copy's. Add `-NoSeed` to make an empty folder instead.

**Tested, 22:33 and 22:36, title screen only, you not needed:**

- Run 1 (own folder): within four seconds of starting, the game wrote all ten settings
  files into the copy's folder and nothing into yours. After 90 seconds at the title
  screen the process was ended. `compare-saves.ps1`: your real folder, all 13 files,
  same SHA-256 as the backup taken just before (`backups\2026-10-17_2233`).
- Run 2 (own folder plus Unreal's `-UserDir=UserData` switch): the game **ignored the
  switch** (no `UserData` folder appeared anywhere) and used the copy's folder again.
  Real folder unchanged (`backups\2026-10-17_2236`). So this game doesn't honour Unreal's
  standard command-line switches, which also explains why `-windowed` did nothing
  earlier. The `-saveddirsuffix=` switch wasn't tried: at best it would make a side folder
  inside or next to your real one.
- The copy's rewritten settings file is identical to yours, so it read its own copy and
  wrote it back as the game does on every start.

**Still to prove, with you at the keyboard:** start the copy, press Enter at the title
(it should say it is loading save data and show your campaign progress), start any
mission, fly for half a minute, quit back to the menu and quit the game through the
menu. Then `compare-saves.ps1` must say "No change", and the copy's own save file
(`UserProfile\...\SaveGames\76561198126172633\ACE7Save.sav`) should have a new time.

**Steam Cloud, in plain words.** Steam itself, not the game, copies your save to Steam
Cloud. Its log shows it checks one file, your real
`SaveGames\76561198126172633\ACE7Save.sav`, every time anything labelled as Ace Combat 7
closes, including the copy. That is how the copy's menu quit at 22:05 got uploaded. When
the copy closed at 22:34, Steam saw that the real save had changed since its last upload
(because I had put the original back) and uploaded it: **Steam Cloud now holds your
original 10 October save again** (Steam's change number 73). From now on the copy never
changes the real file, so Steam finds nothing to upload after a copy run.

## Your saves: what happened

- Before every launch your save folder was backed up and checked (`backups\`, eight
  backups today).
- **The copy used to share your real save folder.** When I quit the copy through its menu
  ("Save and end your current game", 22:05), it rewrote your real save, and Steam Cloud
  uploaded it. The save is encrypted, so I couldn't see what changed; it was 11.5 KB
  smaller. With your OK I put the original back (the 10 Oct file, checksum matches this
  morning's backup). Steam Cloud got the original back at 22:34 (see above). The
  copy-written version is kept in `backups\2026-10-17_2206\`.
- Staying on the title screen and closing from there didn't touch the save. The game
  ignores the window's X and Escape at the title screen, so I ended the process instead.
  Nothing is loaded at that point.
- Since 22:33 the copy has its own save folder (section 4), so this can't happen again
  as long as the copy is started with `tools\start-copy.ps1`.

## Left as you chose

- **Windowed mode** is still on (1600×900 windowed instead of 1920×1080 full screen), so
  your real game will also open in a window. To undo it, set full screen in the game's
  Options, or ask me to copy `Config\GameUserSettings.ini` back from
  `backups\2026-10-17_2133\`. The copy has its own copy of this setting now, so changing
  one no longer changes the other.
- `Config\Engine.ini` has a block the game added that turns off the Sticky Keys shortcut.
  Harmless; the original is in the same backup.
- The stray save the crashed second copy made (`SaveGames\ACE7Save.sav`, not in your
  Steam-ID folder, not synced by Steam Cloud) is still there.

## Rules for test runs from now on

1. Steam open, then start the copy with `tools\start-copy.ps1` (it backs up your saves
   first and gives the copy its own save folder). Never start `Ace7Game.exe` in the copy
   any other way, and never with `-SharedUserFolder` unless the test is about the real
   folder and stays on the title screen.
2. Going past the title screen in the copy is now safe in principle. Until the mission
   run above has been done once, run `tools\compare-saves.ps1` after every run anyway and
   expect "No change".
3. A second copy is started with `-Second` and gets its own folder (`UserProfile2`) and a
   smaller window. Two copies remain a test until the second one gets past "creating
   save data" without crashing.

## Must-do before step 1

- **Own save folder for the copy: done, final proof pending** (the mission run above).
- **Two copies at once:** retry with `-Second`.
- Not tried yet: plan.md's step 0 test 4 (try a few developer commands offline, such as
  `SNL_ArrangeWindows`). UE4SS can now reach them.
